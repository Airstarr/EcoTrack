# ♻️ EcoTrack

**EcoTrack** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Stacks blockchain** using **Clarity** smart contracts. It enables individuals and organizations to log their eco-friendly actions—such as recycling, planting trees, or reducing carbon emissions—and earn **ECO tokens** as rewards for their sustainable contributions.

---

## 🌍 Why EcoTrack?

Climate change and environmental degradation are global challenges. EcoTrack incentivizes sustainability by using blockchain technology to:

* Promote transparency and accountability in eco-actions.
* Reward individuals and organizations for being environmentally conscious.
* Build a verifiable, immutable record of green contributions.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Log eco-friendly actions (e.g., recycling, tree planting).
* 🏆 Earn ECO tokens as rewards.
* 🔍 Transparent action verification.
* 📊 Public leaderboard of top contributors.
* 🔐 Decentralized and secure with Clarity smart contracts.

---

## 🧱 Built With

* **Stacks Blockchain** – A Bitcoin-secured smart contract platform.
* **Clarity** – A decidable, safe smart contract language.
* **Clarinet** – Local development, testing, and deployment tool for Clarity.

---

## 📦 Smart Contract Overview

The core smart contract includes:

* `log-action` – Users log an eco-action with a description and category.
* `verify-action` – An admin or community oracle can verify actions.
* `reward-user` – Verified actions trigger ECO token rewards.
* `get-user-actions` – View all actions logged by a specific user.
* `get-leaderboard` – Returns top contributors based on earned tokens.

## 🔧 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

* [Install Clarinet](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity/clarinet-installation)
* Node.js (if testing with TypeScript)

## 📜 Example Usage

### Log an Eco-Action

```clarity
(log-action "Planted 5 trees in city park" "tree-planting")
```

### Verify an Action

```clarity
(verify-action tx-sender action-id)
```

### Check User Actions

```clarity
(get-user-actions user-principal)
```

## 🔐 Security and Governance

* Only verified actions can earn rewards.
* An optional DAO model can be integrated for action verification.
* Anti-spam logic ensures genuine contributions.

---

## 🌱 Tokenomics

* **ECO Token**

  * Earned via verified eco-actions.
  * Capped supply or mint-per-action model (configurable).
  * Potential DAO utility, staking, or carbon offset use cases.
